This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Pages

The part 1 of the coding challenge is available on the main route, [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
The part 2 of the challenge is available here: [http://localhost:3000/ai-agent](http://localhost:3000/ai-agent)

### Code structure

In `/src` there are two folders, `Ai-agent` and `HeatingSystemModal` and the code for them is separate so it's easier to review.
